<h1>Showcase Submissions</h1>



<p>
Since UX Day Graz is a community event, we would like you to
participate, either as individuals or in small groups, by presenting
in the Community Showcase session.
</p>



<h2>Showcase Presentations</h2>

<p>
We would like each person/small group to put together a five-minute
presentation (a showcase presentation) of themselves and what they do
in user experience (UX), interaction design, or usability.
</p>


<p>
By "small group" we mean:
</p>
<ul>
<li>an individual</li>
<li>a small group of work colleagues</li>
<li>a small research group</li>
<li>a small collection of individuals collaborating say on a project</li>
</ul>



<p>
The presentation should follow this structure:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Who we are? (name(s) and affiliations)</li>
<li>What we do? (UX activities at company/research group)</li>
<li>Short Example of a UX Project:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Initial situation</li>
    <li>Interesting or new approaches</li>
    <li>Pitfalls</li>
    <li>Message and findings</li>
  </ul>
</ol>

<p>
The idea is that everyone gets to know everyone else and something
about what they do.
</p>





<h2>Showcase Submissions</h2>


<p>
Please prepare and submit your showcase video as follows:
</p>
<ul>

<li>
<p>
Prepare your presentation video in a commonly used format (with a
commonly used presentation tool or codec). A suggested way to do this
is to use PowerPoint, set timings for the slides, then Save As... MP4.
</p>
<p>
If, for some reason, we cannot play your presentation video, we may
have to ask you to convert it to a different format.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
The presentation should be maximum five minutes long.
</p>
</li>


<li>
<p>
Fill out and submit the Google form at:
</p>
<blockquote>
<a href="http://goo.gl/EMzuZ5" target="blank">
<code>http://goo.gl/EMzuZ5</code></a>
</blockquote>
<p>
with details about your presentation.
</p>
</li>


<li>
<p>
Your submission will be retrieved and reviewed.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Showcase Session places will be allocated to reflect a balanced
selection of topics and groups, the quality of submissions, and the
order of receipt of submissions.
</p>
</li>


<li>
<p>
The showcase presentations will be recorded and the video recordings
later placed on the UX Day Graz 2017 web site.  By submitting a
showcase presentation, you give your permission for us to record and
publish your presentation.
</p>
</li>


<li>
<p>
Showcase submissions may be rejected due to technical limitations or
at the discretion of the organisers.
</p>
</li>

</ul>



<p>

<p>
The deadline for showcase submissions is Wed 01 Nov 2017 at 23:59 CET.
