UX Day Graz relies on its supporting companies and organisations to
keep it running and to continue to keep it free to attend.
</p>

<p>
Three supporter packages are available:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Platinum Supporter (€ 450): logo included in all event media, display
space for 2 rollups. [Platinum supporters can optionally request a
dedicated table/stand for an extra fee of €100, to use for company
information, a demo, recruiting, etc.]
</li>

<li>
Gold Supporter (€ 300): logo included in all event media, display
space for 1 rollup.
</li>

<li>
Silver Supporter (€ 150): logo included in all event media.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Supporter logos will be included in size and/or duration according to
the supporter category in all event media: web site, posters,
programmes, slideshow during breaks, and in the opening and concluding
sessions.
