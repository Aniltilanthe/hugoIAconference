abstract: "For as long as design has been a profession in its own right,
    practitioners and theorists have reflected on the value of design
    for society. It can be argued that the first design manifesto,
    “Ornament as Crime” by Adolf Loos in 1910, marks the founding
    moment of the professional designer. More than 50 years later, the
    most prominent example of a design values declaration, the “First
    Things First” manifesto from 1964, stated that not all good design
    is also good for socity, but that “good for society” is a
    desirable value in good design.  Today, designers use algorithms
    to build artefacts which can create transformational or even
    disruptive experiences for individuals, groups, and whole
    societies. This talk will discuss the intrinsic properties of
    algorithms as a material, some of the new problems it creates, and
    will put forward a new set of values for UX designers having to
    deal with these issues."

Abstract
</h2>
<p>
    For as long as design has been a profession in its own right,
    practitioners and theorists have reflected on the value of design
    for society. It can be argued that the first design manifesto,
    “Ornament as Crime” by Adolf Loos in 1910, marks the founding
    moment of the professional designer. More than 50 years later, the
    most prominent example of a design values declaration, the “First
    Things First” manifesto from 1964, stated that not all good design
    is also good for socity, but that “good for society” is a
    desirable value in good design.  Today, designers use algorithms
    to build artefacts which can create transformational or even
    disruptive experiences for individuals, groups, and whole
    societies. This talk will discuss the intrinsic properties of
    algorithms as a material, some of the new problems it creates, and
    will put forward a new set of values for UX designers having to
    deal with these issues.
