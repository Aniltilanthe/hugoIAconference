Big Bang Redesign: Smashing Magazine’s 2017 Relaunch, A Case Study
</h2>

<h2 class="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>
You’ve been there: big bang redesigns are usually a very, very bad
idea. Redesigning and rebuilding an existing website from scratch
is risky and unpredictable, and in many cases the level of-
complexity is highly underestimated. In mid-2016, Smashing
Magazine decided to make a big switch from the existing setup to
an entirely new design, focusing on microinteraction and
copywriting.

<p>
In this talk, Vitaly Friedman, editor-in-chief and co-founder of
Smashing Magazine, will share some of the insights into Smashing
Magazine’s Relaunch in 2017 — with decisions made, failures,
successes, lessons learned and shady’n'dirty techniques used along
the way. Among other things, you’ll learn how Smashing Magazine’s
new design came about, how we started, and all the stumbling
blocks we discovered (and had to solve) along the way. Beware: the
session will contain at least 27 illustrations of cats!
